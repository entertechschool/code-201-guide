- As you prepare to take this test, think of it as a quiz covering all of the Code 102 topics. 
- You are not expected to solve these challenges just by looking over the choices. 
- You areÂ expected to use your professional tools and problem-solving skills to empirically find the answers. 
- Take time to work with the code in your editor and in your browser.
