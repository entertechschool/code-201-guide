Consider working with a web site in a repository from GitHub.

A user takes only the following actions:

1. Clones the repository to their computer.
2. Uses the GitHub editor to edit and commit a change to `index.html` directly on the GitHub.com site.
3. Edits `index.html` in VSCode on their computer, without first performing a `git pull`.
4. Uses the `git` command to **add**, **commit**, and **push** their changes to GitHub.

What will be the result?
