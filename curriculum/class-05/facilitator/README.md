# Facilitators Guide: Understanding Images, CSS for Color & Text Styling, and Git Branching

## Overview

This class is a close-out to the About Me Quiz. Students have 3 lab assignments, with one of them completing anything left within their ongoing project. The other two consists of Git branching and CSS practice.

### How does this topic fit?

**Where we've been**:
In the previous class we introduced CSS positioning, functions, and pair programming.

**What are we focusing on in this class**:
In this class, we'll be learning about images and the benefits/disadvantages for each image type. We will also be diving deeper into CSS with color and text styling. Students will also be shown another git flow with branches.

**Where we're headed**:
Next class will be a kickoff to a new project. Students will get their first look into object literals and manipulating the DOM.

## Learning Objectives

Review the detailed objectives in this class's [student-facing readme](../README.md).

## Preparation

1. Skim the class readings and be prepared if students have questions.
1. Review the code demos and be sure you understand how to construct them during lecture. Review the respective markdown file for each demo.
1. Add the starter code for lab-a to the class repo. Instruct students to create a new public repo and copy the starter code into it.
1. Review the [whiteboard diagrams](https://code-fellows.invisionapp.com/freehand/201-Whiteboards-8r4qFnMn2) on the Code Fellow's Invision account or [here](whiteboards/) for lecture.

1. Share this link with the students: <https://medium.freecodecamp.com/things-i-wish-someone-had-told-me-when-i-was-learning-how-to-code-565fc9dcb329#.ih137zeoo>

1. Setup 15 minute 1-on-1 meetings students with each student over the next few days. This will be your opportunity to check in with them individually to review how they are doing in the course so far.

## Lecture Outline
<!-- NOTE TO INSTRUCTOR: If you make any changes to the lecture, make matching changes into LECTURE.md -->

Refer to the [example lecture](LECTURE.md) for lecture details.

### Code review

- Review or code out the solution to the About Me Quiz.
- Share the [warm up page](https://codefellows.github.io/code-201-guide/curriculum/class-05/warm-up/) with the class.
- Balance timing on warm up with code review as needed.

### Images, Color, Text

- **Why**
  - Images, font color, and text are a great way for students to style their applications.
- **What**
  - Images
    - JPEG (.jpg, .jpeg)
    - GIF (.gif)
    - PNG (.png)
- **How**
  - Image Demo:
    - Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the different image file formats listed above.
    - Can use VSCode for image demo - build out HTML and CSS pages.
    - Add image in HTML along with other HTML elements like `<p>` or `<article>`.
    - Style figure and show different ways you can resize image.
  - CSS Color / Font Demo:
    - Using the same CSS file that was used in the Image demo, show how to style the `<p>` or `<article>` elements.
    - Style text using `font-family`, `color`, `line-height`, and `font size`.

### Git branching & deployment

- **Why**
  - Branching allows each developer to branch out from the original code base and isolate their work from others.
  - Allows all risk involved in a merge to be deferred until that point.
- **What**
  - Branches represent an isolated line of development.
- **How**
  - Use a whiteboard to demonstrate branching.
  - Demonstrate using a project that you may have onr your local machine.
    - Create and checkout to a branch.
  - Demonstrate the pull requests and merging the branch back into main.

### Function Review

- Review definition of a function.
- Demonstrate examples on how to return a value or multiple values.
  - This will help students prep for one of the 3 labs that will be due.

### Lab prep

- **Why**
  - Provides students with the tools to be successful with their lab.
- **What**
  - Review Lab 05a, 05b, and 05c instructions in Canvas.
- **How**
  - Lab05a review:
    - Code out the first problem with students so they have an understanding of what is asked of them.
    - Confirm what the function needs to return to meet the test requirements.
    - Point out after question 2 they are NOT allowed to use the arthmetic operators.
    - Students should not touch the test file!
  - Lab05b review:
    - Point out where they should be navigating to in GitHub for deployment.
  - Lab05c review:
    - Walk through a few of the first questions in CSS Diner.
    - Advise students they will need to take a screenshot of the menu once completed.

## Lab Notes

There are three labs assigned for this class:

1. GitHub Branching
   - Starter Code
1. Complete the About Me Quiz
   - Finishing touches on the About Me Quiz
1. CSS tutorial with CSS Diner
   - This lab was published on class 02

## What changed from previous class?

Students will be introduced to a new git workflow with branching. Students also have a heavy lab day with 3 being due.

## What bugs, issues, or surprises have come up in the past for this class?

Gituations may arise with the new branching workflow being introduced.
