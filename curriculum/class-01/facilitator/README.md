# Facilitators Guide: Introduction to Development

## Overview

This day is all about getting everyone off to a good start with the numerous new tools that they will be using in the coming weeks. For many students this is the first time to work in a code editor and the first time to use the command line for file manipulation. These tools are foreign to most students, and students often bring extra anxiety into the first day. It’s an important life marker to have that “first day of school” moment with students by addressing their concerns and anxieties with reassurance. It can be especially helpful during this first week to acknowledge these feelings and assure students that it is normal to feel like the concepts are not clicking right away, but will with time. It can also help throughout this first week to ask TAs to share their 201 experiences and what they have learned from those experiences.

## Learning Objectives

Review the detailed objectives in today's [student-facing readme](../README.md).

## Preparation

1. Skim the daily readings and be prepared if students have questions.
1. Review the code demos and be sure to understand how to construct them within lecture. Review the respective markdown file for each demo.
1. This is the first day of class, so be sure that Canvas assignments are fully published for the course and the GitHub repo is created and populated with the daily class README's.

## Lecture Outline
<!-- NOTE TO INSTRUCTOR: If you make any changes to the lecture, make matching changes into LECTURE.md -->

Refer to the `lecture.md` for lecture details.

## Welcome and Kickoff

- Campus Kickoff
  - Rules/Policies of the Campus
- Full Student Introductions

## All about 201

- Intro to Canvas
  - Show them around the tool and how to find and submit assignments
- Reading Review
  - Quick overview on how to "skim" readings

## Command Line Basics, VSCode Configuration and Code Demo

- **Why**
  - Command Line
    - Terminal use and terminal commands can be a lot faster and more efficient
    - Things done in the terminal can be easily repeatable
  - VSCode Configuration
    - It is important for students to have same linter settings. When they work on teams, it is important that when they pull down projects, they will all be on the same page.
- **What**
  - Everything you do in the command line is related to **files**, **directories**, and **executables**
  - Git and GitHub
    - Git: version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history.
    - GitHub: a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories
  - VSCode is the text editor students will be using. VSCode is a streamlined code editor with support for development operations like version control.
- **How**
  - Go over basic commands ([see cheat sheet](LECTURE-EXAMPLE.md#command-line-basics))
  - Go over VSCode Configuration that students will need to set up for this course([see configs](LECTURE-EXAMPLE.md#configure-vs-code))
  - Go over Linter Setup ([see setup](LECTURE-EXAMPLE.md#setup-your-linter))
  - Build out Code Demo ([Overview Outline](DEMO.md))
    - prompts
    - alerts
    - console.log
    - in-line styles
    - internal styles
  - Run a Lighthouse report from the Chrome DevTools to analyze the accessibility of the application.
  - **NOTE** Some Chrome extensions could inject markup into the HTML code at runtime and could affect the Lighthouse scores. If this happens, advise students to either turn off their Chrome extensions or run their Lighthouse while in an incognito window.
  - Lab Prep
    - Show them how to submit their lab

## Lab Notes

Students will have completed a prework assignment, lab-01a, to set up a repo for storing their reading notes. They should have created a very similar repo for their 102 daily journal. However, some students may come in with their prework incomplete,so make sure to remind students to complete this assignment as a priority before lab-b so they don't fall behind on their readings.

Today's lab utilizes GitHub's gist functionality. [Here is an overview of a gist](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-gists).

At the end of lecture, publish your code to a gist and then show them how to get the link for their gist and where to submit it in Canvas for lab-b.

One detail to note: In lab-b, we help the students set up their JS linter in VSCode and also set a custom .bash_profile that will ultimately show their Git status once we start working with Git. Doing this serves two purposes: 1) Gives us another means of verifying their computer setups; 2) Creates a point of 1-on-1 interaction with the students so we can get to know them better. Work on learning names as you deal with individual students.

### What changed from previous class?

Nothing, this is day one!

## What bugs, issues, or suprises have come up in the past for this class?

- Computer Setup
- Some Chrome extensions could inject markup into the HTML code at runtime and could affect the Lighthouse scores. If this happens, advise students to either turn off their Chrome extensions or run their Lighthouse while in an incognito window.
