## Code Review

- This will be a very large code review
- Some potential topics to address during code review include:
  - The importance of reading and implementing the technical requirements for each lab. Remind students that the TAs use the technical requirements as a reference when grading assignments.
  - The importance of taking the time to plan out their project before jumping into writing code. It is tempting to jump right into the assignment of the day, but planning can save a lot of their debugging time (as well as the time of the instructional staff).

## Code Demo

- Demonastrate prototypal inheritance by adding a method to JavaScript's Number object in Kitten demo and encourage students to add a method to JavaScript's Array class in their Salmon Cookies Lab to calculate daily total for each store.
- This class is heavily focused on CSS and UI/UX. We will introduce Flexbox to the students as another way to layout a page. This is a good time to revisit [Learn Layout](http://learnlayout.com/) as a useful resource for any students struggling with CSS.
- Walk through the proper approach to creating an HTML and CSS project when given a basic wireframe. This will help prepare for the next lab as well.
