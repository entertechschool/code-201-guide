# Facilitators Guide: Advanced Topics in CSS Layouts

## Overview

Of all the classes in the course, this is the one that is left the most wide open. Why? Itâ€™s difficult to predict where the class is going to be at this point due to the heavy challenges of the past two classes. Some students need a class that is mostly review of the first two classes of the module. On the other hand, some students are ready to take on some new material. Most cohorts contain some mix of those two kinds of students. For the purposes of this guide we will assume that the class is mostly a half/half blend of the two extremes.

The new content for this class involves CSS layout, using Flexbox. A structured review of the CSS layout fundamentals is necessary, so as to serve as a foundation for extending into new topics, such as grid systems or responsive design.

### How does this topic fit?

**Where we've been**:
In the previous class students were introduced to Constructor Functions. They also learned how to refactor their unordered lists into an HTML table.

**What are we focusing on in this class**:
In this class, students will be learning more advanced topic in CSS layouts. One of their lab assignments will be to layout a page using CSS and HTML to match a given wireframe.

**Where we're headed**:
Next class will focus on events and gathering information from an HTML form.

## Learning Objectives

Review the detailed objectives in the class's [student-facing readme](../README.md).

## Preparation

1. Skim the readings and be prepared if students have questions.
1. Review the code demos and be sure to understand how to construct them within lecture. Review the respective markdown file for each demo.
1. Ensure that your class repository for this class, has a folder called `lab` with the following content:
    - The `images` folder inside of `lab-a`, containing the required images for lab.
    - The `assets` folder located under the `lab-b`, containing the images required for the wrap up of the Salmon Cookies lab. 
1. For fun, share with the students the image located in the `assets/peter-griffin-css.gif`.  
   - Show this picture with the context that CSS is hard without a process, but we can take away that frustration if we apply direction to how we code CSS!

## Lecture Outline

### Code review

Code review is a big part of this class. Expect to spend at least an hour in code review, if not 90 minutes.


### Prototypal Inheritance

- **Why**
  - Prototypal interitance is dynamic. Objects and methods can be shared, extended, and copied.
- **What**
  - Prototypal inheritance is the ability to access object properties from another object.
- **How**
  - Demonstrate prototypal inheritance by adding a method to an existing Javascript Object.
  - Reinforce prototypal inheritance with the Kitten demo by converting cat ages from human to cat years.  
  - Add a method to JavaSript's Number object.
    - Encourage students to incorporate this into their Salmon Cookies Lab; perhaps total all values in an array for daily store totals.

### Wireframing

- **Why**
  - Wireframing is important because it gives the client, developer, and designer an opportunity to walk through the structure of the website without getting sidetracked by design elements such as colors and images.
- **What**
  - A wireframe is a two-dimensional illustration of a web page's interface that shows the main elements of a web page layout as boxes with brief descriptions.
- **How**
  - Walk through the proper approach to creating an HTML and CSS project when given a basic wireframe. This will help prepare for the next lab as well.

### CSS Flexbox

- **Why**
  - Flexbox is a simple way of dividing and aligning boxes.
- **What**
  - Flexbox allows us to lay a collection of items out in one direction or another.
  - Allows development of "grid" style layouts (not CSS Grid, but visual grids).
- **How**
  - Use CodePen or VSCode to demonstrate flexbox.
  - Instructor may also pass on the following site to students to help them with flexbox practice: [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/)

## Lab Notes

The lab is not as intense as the previous three classes. Students should focus on mopping up any non-functional pieces of their code, and adding styling as they are able to.

## What changed from previous class?

Students will be taking a small break from JavaScript and focusing heavily on CSS and styling.

## What bugs, issues, or suprises have come up in the past for this class?

No bugs or issues have come up for this particular class.
