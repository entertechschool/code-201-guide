# Advanced JS Topics and CSS Animations

## Learning Objectives

Review the detailed objectives in the [student-facing readme](../README.md).

## Overview

In this class we will introduce re-instantiation. This is challenging material for the students to even grasp the architecture of the demo, much less implement it on their own. Be sure to point out that this is something they will be expected to implement on their final projects as well.

Depending on the skill level of the cohort, you may choose to spend the remainder of the time discussing advanced JS topics and/or CSS animations. Refer to the main daily class README for advanced JS topics.

## Preparation

1. Open the [template repository](https://github.com/codefellows/201-lab-14) for the workshop portion of the class.
1. Skim the daily readings and be prepared if students have questions.
1. Review the code demos and be sure to understand how to construct them within lecture. Review the respective markdown file for each demo.
1. Work with your principal instructor directly to conduct the [Psychological Safety talk](./PSYCH_SAFETY). This discussion should last about an hour at the beginning of the class.
1. Have groups created for project week and share them with the students. Refer to the [Projects doc](PROJECTS).
1. Upload `css-animations.md` file is uploaded to the daily class repo.
1. Create and post paired-programming partners for the lab.

## Lecture

1. Psychological safety (1 hour)
1. Code review (30 min)
   - Final review of Odd Duck Products
1. Discuss final project ideas (30 min)
   - Publish groups and discuss requirements
1. CSS Animations
1. Reinstantiation of JS objects from local storage (30-45 min)
1. Code 301 Entrance exam to be open and set to close at the end of class 15.

## Lab Notes

Lab for this class is divided into 2 parts, and will challenge the students in a number of ways.

1. It's going require them to perform their work in an existing codebase, so they'll have to familiarize themselves with the code, where things are and how the functions connect.
1. The lab will require them to use multiple .js files and multiple .html files ... an architecture they've not yet seen.
1. LocalStorage will be required to share data between pages. This is a HUGE takeaway for them!

Spend about 30 - 45 minutes work-shopping this with the student before sending them out to work with their partner.

1. Show them how to create a new repository from a [template repository](https://github.com/codefellows/201-lab-14).
1. Remind them how to add a collaborator, since they'll be pairing with another student.
1. Review the architecture with them.
   - How would start the website?
   - What does the code do?
   - Work with the class on how to understand where the app "starts" and how everything connects together.
   - Maybe write the saving of data to local storage with them, collectively to help them start out.

This lab is a pair programming lab. This is a tricky timed lab, with provided starter code; groups are not allowed to change the HTML. Students will have 4 hours to work on the lab. It can help to create the pairs from the project groups to catch any potential conflicts, then post the project groups later in the afternoon so adjustments can be made, if needed.

The assignment is to create a second page for the Odd Duck voting app and have the chart show only on that separate page. The stretch goal is to add CSS styling to the application.

## General Comments

During class time you need to discuss with students how to approach the 301 entrance exam. Students may take the exam at the time of their choosing at any time between the class 14 and the end of class 15. Students may utilize as much time as necessary during that time block, generally students complete it in under 3 hours. The exam is open note, and they are encouraged to write and run code to figure out the answers. Tell students directly that they may not collaborate with others who are currently taking the test or have done so in the past (e.g.: online test answers).
