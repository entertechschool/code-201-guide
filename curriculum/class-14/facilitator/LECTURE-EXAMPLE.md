# Lecture

* Code Review
  * Today's code review can be brief, focusing on the local storage functionality, as most of the other functionality was covered during code review earlier in the week.

## CSS Animations

* Utilize the supplied demo or create your own. The intent is to give the students enough exposure to CSS animations so that they are comfortable exploring them on their own.

## Advanced JS Topics

* The public-facing readme has a list of potential topics for this segment. Edit them as needed for your cohort.

## Reinstantiation of JS objects from local storage

* This demo is about showing students how to use local storage as a persistence layer between two HTML pages. It is a challenging topic for them, and it is difficult to decide how much code to give them in advance (to save time). Ultimately, no one knows your cohort better than you. There should be some blend of working with existing code, and also adding functionality.

* Lab prep: See the whiteboard images below for examples of how to help the students prepare for the lab. I recommend coding the first TODO in app.js to help the students understand the process. This is an extremely challenging lab, and many students do not finish it. That is fine; telling them, "This codebase is more complex than you've seen so far, but also less complex than what you will create on your own in the final project" really sets the tone for projects.
