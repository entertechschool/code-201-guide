# 201 Project Prep

## Group Creation

Project groups should be decided by the instructor and TA team to ensure balanced skill levels in all groups. Ideally, groups should contain four or five members; a strong team of three members could also be successful. Be conscious of personality traits where possible.

An alternate approach to groups: decide the groups among the instructional staff, but do not tell the students yet. Then in lab, when they are pair-programming, have them work with a future possible team member. This is a great way to test out any questionable pairings before assigning students to teams.

## Project Examples

Review student final projects from prior cohorts, again, striving for concepts in UI/UX and also to help students get a feel for the scope of the final projects. Students should have completed the project pitch Canvas assignment by now, so it is really time for students to start mentally transitioning into a Project Week mentality.

## Project Prep

The project teams will discuss their ideas together and ultimately select a project idea to pitch to the instructional team. By the beginning of the next class, groups should have a pitch idea or two of what they would like to create.

Refer to the common curriculum for the prep assignments for project week. All of these assignments are expected to be completed by end of class 15 (including lab time). Class 15 will be primarily dedicated to these assignments.
