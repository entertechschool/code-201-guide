# Facilitators Guide: JS Debugging and More CSS Layout

## Overview

This is another big class for code review as the students are getting their Salmon Cookie apps wrapped up. Ideally, at this point the students should be more focused on the look and feel of the app than its JavaScript functionality. That said, this is the best time to re-engage with debugging concepts, providing some reminders and refreshes on what the students have experienced with JS debugging, and to get into some advanced and under-the-hood topics that they are now ready to consider.

The CSS layout component of this class will again depend upon the progress of a particular cohort. If more time is needed on the fundamentals, or in a hands-on exploration of grid systems, then that is what must be done. If the class is more advanced, however, this could be a chance to explore topics such as CSS frameworks or responsive design.

### How does this topic fit?

**Where we've been**:
In the previous class students learned about JavaScript events and event handling. They were also tasked with building an HTML form into their application with the purpose of adding new stores to their sales table.

**What are we focusing on in this class**:
In this class students will be diving into JavaScript debugging workflows. Students also have another pair programming lab that will focus on CSS layout.

**Where we're headed**:
Next class will begin a new project! This project will hopefully help cement concepts learned from the previous project.

## Learning Objectives

Review the detailed objectives in this class's [student-facing readme](../README.md).

## Preparation

1. Add the contents located in the `lab-assets` folder into your class repository under the `class-10/lab-a` directory.
1. This class's lab is a pair programming lab. 
   - Post pairs before lab time. 
   - Note: Take skill levels and overall understanding of the content into consideration.
3. Skim the readings and be prepared if students have questions.

## Lecture Outline
<!-- NOTE TO INSTRUCTOR: If you make any changes to the lecture, make matching changes into LECTURE.md -->

Refer to the [example lecture](LECTURE.md) for lecture details.

### Code review
  
- Focus on Salmon Cookies build out.

### JavaScript Debugging

- **Why**
  - We want error free code!
- **What**
  - Debugging is the process of detecting and removing errors in software code.
- **How**
  - Discuss as a class different ways to debug code. Get students involved and ask them for examples.
  - Discuss the differet types of error messages they can encounter in the console. Provide an example of each error type.
  - Instructors can choose to use a Replit riddled with bugs and put students in small groups to find bugs within the code.
    - Online classes should use Zoom breakout rooms (or equivalent) for this.

### Lab prep

- **Why**
  - Provides students with the tools to be success with their lab.
- **What**
  - Review Lab 10a instructions in Canvas.
- **How**
  - Advise students this is a timeboxed lab and they will be working in pairs.
  - Direct students to the assets for this lab in the class repository.
  - Refer to lab notes below for additional information.

## Lab Notes

Students will have approximately four hours to work on this assignment, getting their project as close as possible to the recipe mockup. The secondary purpose of the cutoff time is to encourage students to head home and get some rest.

The assignment is more about "crank through a lot of CSS work" than striving for an ideal solution. Present it as a puzzle, and encourage students to do it as collaboratively as possible to compare each otherâ€™s solutions. If good effort is given, grade for full credit. It's more about process than product.

The intent of this lab is that they dive into a problem, come up with a plan to attack it, go through the mechanics of managing the image resources and setting up the HTML, and then do whatever they can with CSS. It hits a lot of stuff. And ideally lots of teaching happens while they are working, when the instructor circulates and gives tips.

## What changed from previous class?

No big changes from previous class.

## What bugs, issues, or suprises have come up in the past for this class?

Students may still be having a hard time getting the grand totals in their table functioning correctly within their applications. The code review for this class could be a help for a lot of students still struggling with that component.
