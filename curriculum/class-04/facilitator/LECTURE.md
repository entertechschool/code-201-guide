# Lecture Notes

## Lecture: HTML Links, JS Functions, and Intro to CSS Layout

* Code Review
  * It was intentional to avoid discussing `typeof` and `parseInt` previously. Hopefully students realized that `prompt` returns a string, even if the user inputs a number, and were guided to the solution by Googling the answer or reaching out to a member of the instructional staff
  * Depending on the level of understanding (and frustration) during lab 3, it may be helpful to walk through an example approach to solving one or both of the questions from their lab assignment.

## Lab: Pair Programming and More Extensions to About Me

Here's the basics of what you need to know about *pair programming*. This is a methodology for work in software development that is increasingly more popular and widespread (not only in development work, but also in interview processes), and we place a high value on training our students to pair program effectively. Students can reference details in the lab assignment.

The process of forking and cloning a repository is brand new to most 201 students, so the explanation should not be rushed. Students should come out of the lab setup with an understanding of the terminal commands and GitHub procedures needed to make certain that there is consistency between the code base in all four locations: their GitHub account, their personal computer, their partner's GitHub account, and their partner's personal computer. The concepts of forking, pulling, and creating pull requests will likely be brand new.

Plan to run a pair programming demo along with another member of the instructional staff, such as a TA. As a backup you can use a volunteer from the class. A live demo is much more useful for students than watching a video. There is an example in [DEMO.md](./DEMO.md).  Encourage students to ask for a reminder during lab time if they forget any of the steps.

* In pair programming there are two developers working on a single body of code on a single computer.
* One member of the pair is the Driver, and this person will be the one doing all of the actual typing work on the laptop. The Driver will be working on the Navigator's code by way of forking and cloning the Navigator's repository.
* The other member of the pair is the Navigator, and this person will work with only their voice and their thoughts.
* The Navigator does not touch the keyboard, nor does the Navigator work on their laptop "on the side". The Navigator is fully engaged with the work that the pair is doing, typically using a piece of scratch paper to sketch diagrams, take notes, or list ideas. At most the Navigator uses their laptop to perhaps keep a copy of this assignment document open or to look up something needed to write the code, such as a reference page like MDN.
* Under no circumstances does the Navigator work on any code on their laptop: for the pair programming process to be effective, both parties must be fully engaged on the code they're working on together.
* The lab time should be divided into two sections of approximately two hours each. At the halfway mark, students should swap roles and work on the other person's code. Remind students to watch the clock and determine the best point to swap roles.
* In the case of an odd number of students, one group will have three members and they should rotate through three roles: Driver, Navigator, Observer. Each student should take on each role one time. They will need to be even more mindful about watching the clock to ensure that equal time is devoted to all three projects. Take note of the students in this group and ensure that they are not in a group of three in weeks 2 and 3.
