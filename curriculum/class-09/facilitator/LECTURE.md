# Lecture Notes

## Code Review

- Gauge the class's experiences from both labs 7 and 8 when planning code review. 
- Options: 
  - Review broken code. 
  - Rebuild application from the ground up, making sure to highlight good code practices and solicit student input.
- Some common points to reiterate:
  - Contextual `this`
  - Naming conventions
  - Organization of code
  - General patterns
  
## Code Demo

1. Begin with a basic demonstration of event listeners, such as making a `div` with a click event listener in CodePen
1. Demonstrate HTML forms and adding event listeners to the submit button. 
1. Make sure to emphasize `preventDefault`
1. Show examples of both inline callback functions and separately-defined callback functions. 
1. Show adding a form as an extension of the previous class's demo code, to show what it looks like to build that form into your existing code base.  
1. Demonstrate the syntax of `document.querySelectorAll()` when the form's callback function manipulates the DOM, which will help prepare students for re-rendering their totals row in lab.
