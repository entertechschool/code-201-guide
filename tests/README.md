# Test
You have unlimited re-takes on quizzes.
Quizzes are open-book. It's more about what you can figure out than what you have memorized. Feel free to utilize resources such as your dev console, Google, Stack Overflow, and others while taking quizzes.
Quizzes have two main purposes:
To get you to re-engage with the content in a different way, reinforcing your knowledge.
To help you prepare for the Code 301 entrance exam, which you will take at the end of Module 3. There is a minimum threshold you must pass on that exam (80%), and also, that exam factors into your grade in this class.
